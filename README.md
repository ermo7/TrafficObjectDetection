Traffic Object Detection and Traffic Density Estimation Project

8.2	System Architecture for Traffic Object Detection and Density Estimation
8.2.1	Frontend Interface Design
  The system’s user interface serves as the point of interaction, providing users with an intuitive way to upload videos and retrieve processed results. This interface is divided into two main pages:
  Upload Page (upload.html): The user can upload traffic video data and select a YOLO model for processing. The page is designed using HTML5 and Bootstrap to ensure responsive behavior across devices. Users are presented with multiple model options.The use of a clean design with form validation ensures ease of use and clarity in user actions. The uploaded video is then sent to the backend for processing via a secure POST request.
  Processed Page (processed.html): After the video has been processed, the results are displayed on this page. The core of this page is the video playback component, where the user can view the annotated output, which includes bounding boxes, object classifications, and traffic density information. Additionally, a detailed Traffic Density Report is generated, showing vehicle counts, average speed, and vehicle types for different segments of the video. The system logs the object detection process for each frame and presents it in a Log Section, aiding in debugging and transparency of the detection process. This logging capability is essential for detailed performance evaluation and identifying edge cases where the model might struggle.
8.2.2	Backend Processing Workflow
  Model Selection and Deployment: Upon receiving the video upload request, the backend identifies the selected YOLO model. Each model—YOLOv8n (nano), YOLOv8m (medium), YOLOv8l (large), or custom-trained models—is optimized for specific scenarios, including performance, computational cost, and accuracy. The backend is implemented in Python, leveraging PyTorch for model execution. The flexibility to switch between pre-trained and custom-trained models allows for comparative analysis and experimentation across different traffic datasets.
  Frame-by-Frame Processing: The uploaded video is processed in a frame-by-frame manner. Each frame is passed through the selected YOLO model, which generates bounding boxes, class probabilities, and confidence scores for detected objects. These outputs are filtered based on a confidence threshold, ensuring that only high-confidence detections are retained.
  Traffic Density Estimation: In addition to object detection, the system computes traffic density by dividing the video into segments. The traffic density is categorized based on the number of detected vehicles and their spatial distribution in each frame. The system can handle various traffic environments (e.g., highways, urban roads) and output real-time traffic density information for traffic management applications. Each segment’s traffic density is visualized in the user interface, using color codes to represent different levels of congestion.
  Post-Processing and Data Aggregation: The system aggregates the detection results from all frames and calculates the average speed of vehicles, the total vehicle count, and other relevant traffic metrics. These results are then presented in a report format, highlighting key traffic parameters like the number of detected vehicles, traffic density levels, and the types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, buses) detected.     
  These metrics help quantify the traffic situation, making the system highly relevant for smart city applications and autonomous driving research.
  Model Selection and Optimization
  YOLOv8, the latest iteration of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model, was chosen due to its balance of speed and accuracy, particularly for real-time traffic detection applications:
  YOLOv8n (Nano): This lightweight version is highly optimized for environments with constrained computational resources, such as edge devices or cloud-based systems with limited GPU access (e.g., Google Colab). Its lower computational demand makes it ideal for real-time applications but with some limitations in detecting smaller objects.
  YOLOv8m (Medium) and YOLOv8l (Large): These models are more computationally expensive but offer higher accuracy, making them suitable for environments where performance is more critical than computational cost. They are used for comparative analysis, providing insights into how model complexity influences detection accuracy and speed.  
  Custom YOLOv8 Models: Custom versions of YOLOv8 were trained on a traffic-specific dataset containing 21 vehicle classes and one class. 
 Post-Processing and Visualization
  Bounding Box and Label Rendering: For each detected object, the bounding box and its label (e.g., "car", "bus") are rendered onto the video frames. This step ensures that the user can visually verify the performance of the detection model.
  Traffic Density Report: The processed video is segmented, and each segment’s traffic density is calculated and displayed. The report is interactive, allowing users to toggle between segments to analyze traffic conditions throughout the video. Each segment is color-coded based on traffic density, providing an intuitive view of congestion levels.
  Logs for Transparency: Detailed logs of the processing steps are maintained and displayed in the user interface. These logs include information on the number of frames processed, detected objects, and any anomalies encountered during processing.
Integration with Smart Traffic Systems
  This system is designed with scalability and flexibility in mind, making it suitable for integration into larger smart traffic monitoring infrastructures. By processing real-time video feeds, it can provide actionable data for traffic management systems, including vehicle counts, congestion analysis, and traffic density estimation. The modular nature of the system allows for future expansion, such as integrating additional data sources like LIDAR or IoT-based traffic sensors.
